# 🏦 Bankquill – Banking Transaction System

Bankquill is a Java-based banking transaction system designed to simulate core banking operations with a strong focus on reliability, data integrity, and clean software architecture.  
This project is developed as part of the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)** and showcases a full software development lifecycle including backend logic, testing, automation, and documentation.

## 📌 Project Overview
Bankquill provides a secure environment for managing user bank accounts, performing deposits and withdrawals, and tracking complete transaction history.  
The system applies essential software engineering concepts such as **OOP**, **exception handling**, **collections**, **database/file handling**, and both **manual & automated testing**.
